# Straw Hat Pirates Crew Registration

A SwiftUI iOS app replicating a dynamic crew registration form inspired by One Piece, plus a custom profile screen from Dribbble. Built for a college iOS development assignment to showcase layout mastery, form validation, and interactive UI components.

## Features

**Part 1: Straw Hat Pirates Form**
- Real-time validation for pirate name, Den Den Mushi email, bounty ID (2-20 chars), and matching Devil Fruit powers
- Interactive toggles for crew loyalty and treasure updates, plus bounty slider (50M-500M berries) with formatted display
- One Piece-themed styling with custom colors, scrollable layout, and success alert that resets the form

**Part 2: Profile Screen**
- Editable fields for personal email, school email, college, and secure password with show/hide toggle
- Email validation, notifications toggle, and save button with confirmation alert
- Clean card-based design adapted from Dribbble with profile image, circular avatar, and modern input styling

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI for declarative UI and state management
- ScrollView, VStack/HStack layouts, and precise padding/spacing
- Custom colors, monospaced fonts for bounty, and icon integrations

## Development Approach
Focused on pixel-perfect replication using SwiftUI previews for rapid iteration. Prioritized clean state separation, meaningful variable names, and reusable components per assignment guidelines. Handled edge cases like invalid emails and mismatched passwords with visual feedback—no compiler warnings.[file:1][file:2][file:4]

Run directly in Xcode—no external dependencies.
